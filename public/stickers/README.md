# Floating Stickers

This folder contains the sticker images that will float across the website alongside the hearts.

## Instructions

1. Add your sticker images to this folder
2. Name them: `sticker1.png`, `sticker2.png`, `sticker3.png`, etc.
3. Recommended: 5-10 sticker images
4. File format: PNG with transparent background works best
5. Size: Small images (100-200px) work well

## Tips

- Use fun, romantic stickers (hearts, stars, flowers, emojis, etc.)
- PNG format with transparency looks best
- Keep file sizes small for faster loading
- The stickers will automatically rotate and scale as they float

## Update the Code

After adding your stickers, update the sticker count in `src/App.tsx`:
- Look for the line: `const stickerCount = 5;`
- Change the number to match how many sticker files you added
